# Project Title

A brief description of your project.  
E.g., "This project implements a deep learning model for image classification using PyTorch."

---

## 📌 Introduction

Provide a clear and concise explanation of your project goals, background, and what problem it solves.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Description of the dataset used (e.g., source, format, size).
- Optionally, include instructions on how to download or prepare the dataset.

Example:

```bash
wget https://example.com/dataset.zip
unzip dataset.zip -d ./data/
```

Make sure your data directory is structured as follows:

```
data/
├── train/
├── val/
└── test/
```

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/config.yaml
```

You can customize training parameters in the `configs/config.yaml` file.

---

## 🔍 Inference

To run inference on a single image or batch:

```bash
python inference.py --input_path path/to/image_or_folder --checkpoint path/to/model.ckpt
```

The output predictions will be saved in `./results/`.

---

## 📈 Results

Optionally include your performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) and example outputs here.
